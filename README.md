## Use case:

Video file path: $HOME/Downloads/18416701210/YDXJ0273.MP4 
Video start time:   2025-03-30 10:02:30+00:00
Garmin start time:  2025-03-30 09:05:14+00:00

The start time of the video is 1 hour ahead and the minutes are not accurate...

The lap time beep in the video occurs after 7 seconds.
The lap time in the fit file is between 0 and 240 seconds (reference time of the video).

The following command solves the time problems and generates the video.

```
../venv/bin/python main.py --fit-file $HOME/Downloads/18416701210/18416701210_ACTIVITY.fit --video-files $HOME/Downloads/18416701210/YDXJ0273.MP4 --video-output-path $HOME/Downloads/18416701210/out.mp4 --video-lap-time-in-secs 7 --render-config-file ./configs/1k-map-and-stats.json --lap-time-search-window-in-secs 0 240 --video-offset-start-in-secs 0 --video-hours-delta -1
```
